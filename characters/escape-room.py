a list of the rooms in the game and a brief description of the setting, a bullet point list of all the
puzzles and how to solve them. This won't be seen by the user, it will only be stored for reviewing the
game afterwards and evaluating it. So please write that when I say to you "SUMMARY" and I when
I say to you "START" you can set the scene for the user because that will be the first test they will see.
After that the user will talk with you instead of me.
